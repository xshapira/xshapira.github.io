I'm an early-bird Python dev who starts his day with a piping hot coffee and a good nonfiction book. I'm all about self-improvement, so I try to squeeze in some coding practice
and a workout before my two little ones wake up and take over the house. Speaking of which,
if you need any tips on coding with toddlers, hit me up - I've become a master at typing
with one hand while holding a baby in the other.
